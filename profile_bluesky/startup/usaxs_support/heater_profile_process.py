"""
Kickoff a temperature profile on the sample heater as a Bluesky plan.

This program is started/stopped/restarted from
``heater_profile_manager.sh``), in directory
``~/.ipython/profile/bluesky/usaxs_support/``.

Imports ``~/.ipython/user/heater_profile.py``.

This file watches an EPICS PV to trigger a heater schedule
as defined in ``heater_profile.planHeaterProcess()``.  The schedule
is executed as a Bluesky plan with a local RunEngine.  Since
no documents are collected here (no subscriptions to the local RE),
the only output from this program is via EPICS PVs and log files.

All configuration is communicated via EPICS PVs
which are interfaced here as ophyd EpicsSignal objects.

See https://github.com/APS-USAXS/ipython-usaxs/issues/482 for details.
